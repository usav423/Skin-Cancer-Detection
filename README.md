# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin cancer detection using deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), involves training a model to identify cancerous lesions from skin images.
The process typically includes the following steps:

Data Collection: 
Gathering a large dataset of labeled skin images, including various types of skin cancer and benign conditions.
Preprocessing: 
Preparing the images through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance and generalization.
Model Architecture: 
Designing or using pre-existing CNN architectures, which are well-suited for image analysis due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers.
Training: 
Feeding the preprocessed images into the CNN, which learns to extract features and classify the images based on the provided labels. This involves iterating through the dataset multiple times and adjusting the model's parameters using optimization techniques like backpropagation.
Validation and Testing:
Evaluating the model's performance on a separate set of images to ensure it can generalize well to new, unseen data. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are commonly used.
Deployment:
Implementing the trained model in a real-world application, such as a diagnostic tool that can assist dermatologists in identifying potential skin cancers from patient images.
Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, have shown high accuracy and efficiency in detecting skin cancer, sometimes even surpassing human experts in diagnostic performance.
